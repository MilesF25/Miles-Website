                <p class="subtitle">Software Engineer and Cybersecurity Enthusiast</p>
                <p>I'm enjoy combining software engineering and cybersecurity, Im still a beginner in cybersecurity but
                    I'm looking for opportunities to getting more experience in the field.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I'm someone who likes building things that actually make sense. I started learning development because I
                enjoyed
                figuring out how systems work and turning ideas into something real on the screen. Over time, I've
                worked on projects
                that pushed me to learn more about clean design, problem-solving, and making things easy for people to
                use.</p>

            <p>I'm still growing, still experimenting, and still finding my lane in tech. I like taking on projects that
                challenge
                me to think differently—whether it's improving a layout, exploring new tools, or creating something from
                scratch. I
                care about building things that are simple, functional, and a little bit better than they were
                yesterday.</p>

            <p>Outside of coding, I'm usually learning something new, playing with ideas, or getting inspired by people
                who
                build cool things. I believe progress comes from staying curious and showing up consistently, and that's
                the mindset I
                bring into every project.</p>

                <p>I've visited 12 countries and counting, I once built a website in 24 hours for a hackathon (and
                    won!),
                    and I have an irrational love for perfectly organized code. My ideal weekend involves good music,
                    great
                    food, and zero bugs in production.</p>
